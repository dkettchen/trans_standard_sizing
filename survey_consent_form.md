## Data policy/Consent form

By participating in this survey, you consent to your anonymous responses being published and used for this research project and any potential future research projects looking to reuse this dataset.

Any sensitive data, like age or medical information, will be collected as generically as possible and anonymised where not already anonymous before publishing.

No participant will be individually identifyable based on their published responses. 

<!-- TODO what survey site will we be using?
TODO how does survey site store data while survey is running? -->

After the survey concludes the project’s data, including the anonymised, raw survey responses, will be stored and available in a [public repository on my github](https://github.com/dkettchen/trans_standard_sizing).

Once the data has been processed into trans standard measurements, they will be published on that repo, on socials, and sent out to anyone who has opted into our mailing list.
<!-- TODO figure out data stuff around mailing list -->
