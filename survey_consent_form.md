## Data policy/Consent form

All data collected in this survey will be anonymous and anonymised.

Any sensitive data will be collected in generic ways to avoid identifyable specifics. (ex. banded age groups, ex. whether or not one has had certain common medical transition interventions but no details)

Only data relevant to the project will be collected. (ex. transition interventions that don’t change measurements/shapes won’t be asked about)

There is one optional question to enable me to locate the measurements of the people I’ll be using as fit models to pattern test and fit sample garments on in the data set. This question will be removed to re-anonymise them before the survey answers are published.

<!-- TODO what survey site will we be using?
TODO how does survey site store data while survey is running? -->

After the survey concludes the project’s data, including the anonymised, raw survey responses, will be stored and available in a [public repository on my github](https://github.com/dkettchen/trans_standard_sizing).

Once the data has been processed into trans standard measurements, they will be published on that repo, on socials, and sent out to anyone who has opted into our mailing list.
<!-- TODO figure out data stuff around mailing list -->

By participating in this survey, you consent to your provided responses being collected, stored, published, and processed in this way.
