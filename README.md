## The Trans Standard Sizes Project
<!-- project description -->

Fashion industry uses a set of standard measurements to "grade" their sewing patterns for different sizes. This way most people are able to go to a store and find clothes that roughly fit them.

However these standard sizes are made with cis people in mind, meaning most trans people struggle to find off-the-rack clothes that fit them.

Most of us did fit into our birth sex' sizes pre-transition, so it's not like our proportions are any more inconsistent than cis people's to the point that they'd inherently need custom tailoring. We're just trans!

If we had a set of standard measurements for trans people, one could create multi-size sewing patterns that will roughly fit the average trans person as well as what cis people can expect from store-bought clothes.

> Ex. If I make a suit pattern graded for transmascs, any transmasc with sewing skills (or access to someone else's sewing skills) could make a suit that fits them as well as what cis men can buy at the store, without actually having to learn how to pattern draft from scratch.

This would not only be useful to trans people and their loved ones making them clothes at home, but also to anyone in fashion industry/clothing manufacturing who has trans clients.

> Ex. I need high-vis at work, but don't fit standard-issue. Ill-fitting PPE is not regulation, so we're looking into getting our manufacturer to make me custom high-vis, which they'll need to my measurements for.
If I had a handy chart of trans standard sizes, I could just send them that, go "this is my size, just make it to these measurements". 
It would also enable them to make a graded trans pattern once and have it on file to reuse for any repeat or new trans customers.

### Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to produce standard sizing for trans people who struggle to find clothes off-the-rack post-transition, that will fit those trans people as well as clothes from their birth sex's aisle fit them pre-transition.

Its scope is laid out in more detail in our [methodology doc](methodology.md).

## Who is running this project?
<!-- about me -->

Hi! My name is Ren Zoller (@dkettchen). I'm a gender non-conforming trans man in my late 20s based in Manchester, UK. 

I was a femme-presenting nonbinary for about a decade and only started successfully being able to pass as male as recently as 2024 (5+ years into medical transition). 
With misgendering suddenly no longer being unavoidable, I had to actually seriously engage with men's fashion for the first time in my life.

As someone who has been obsessed with fashion and had no problem buying clothes I wanted off-the-rack most of my life, switching to men's fashion exclusively has been a very frustrating process (albeit worthwhile due to the no more misgendering).

- Men's fashion follows different rules and shape language than women's (ex. men's pant waist is in a fully different spot than women's), so most of my previous garments are useless to it.

- I don't fit standard men's sizes, so I can't just go to the store and buy new items that fit me, even from the limited selection available there.

- And even as a self-taught seamster making my own clothes, most sewing resources only cover women's fashion. 
Men's specific resources are highly limited (men only wear business pants and suit jackets, right??) and their methods often aren't very robust outside of using cis standard measurements (my measurements will literally break their dang clown math whenever I try to follow supposedly "bespoke" drafting methods).

I know I'm by far not the only trans person with this problem. So many of us (transmasc or transfemme) struggle to find clothing in the right size and shape, and I know notably a lot of transmascs are put off by the perceived lack of options among men's fashion.

I want to make fashion more accessible and fun to us again (*without* every last one of us having to essentially become a fully-qualified tailor about it).
This research project will form a core part of being able to do that.


In my day job I work as a data engineer at Metrolink, and am a degree apprentice in data analysis at Manchester Metropolitan University.

This project will be my entry to MMU's [Making Great Community Incubator 2026](https://rise.mmu.ac.uk/activity/making-great-community-incubator-2026/) in hopes of securing some mentoring and funding for making sample garments from the final measurements to tour the local fashion, tech, and LGBT+ events with and raise awareness about the project.

## What will the project entail?

1) A survey asking relevant trans people to submit their measurements and answer some questions on their body (bodytype, transition state, etc) and relationship to standard sizing pre- and post-transition

2) Data processing to extract trans standard measurements and other insights from that dataset

3) Producing sample garments using these measurements as proof of concept to present the project at fashion/tech/lgbt+ events

    - Some garments will be drafted and sewn by me, but I also hope to have some made by industry manufacturers to demonstrate industry use (ex. PPE).

    - This process will be considered an application of the results of this project more than an actual part of the project, so I will likely not be including any drafting instructions or patterns in the published project data. (I do plan on publishing free-to-download multi-sized sewing patterns on my own website, they just won't form part of this project.)

    - I will probably include photos of the final garments though.

4) Writing up an academic report/paper about the project's findings to be peer reviewed and published in relevant academic/industry/community outlets

    - This will help get the project taken seriously by and enable it to be useful to both academia and the fashion industry, not just individuals in the trans community and its allies.

    <!-- 
    May also include in the paper my finding that trans measurements break existing pattern drafting methods (demonstrated w our standard measurements rather than my own -> to prove this is a problem in general for drafting clothes for trans ppl w existing methods, not just in my individual case) -> that coming up with more robust methods is another bit of research to be looked into (even if that additional research may not happen within the limits of this project, but would be a future one)
