## The Trans Standard Sizing Project
<!-- project description -->

Fashion industry uses a set of standard measurements to draft and "grade" their sewing patterns for different sizes. This way most people are able to go to a store and find clothes that roughly fit them. These measurements were made based on prior anthropometry studies measuring the general population, which means they are made with cis people's proportions in mind.

A lot of trans people struggle to find clothes that fit them off-the-rack, as medical transition has its limitations and trans proportions differ from those of cis people of the opposite birth sex. 

> Ex. Bones seal off after one's initial puberty, meaning even if you get HRT after that, they won't change anymore.

Existing sewing resources also heavily rely on these cis standard measurements, meaning even custom making clothes for trans people requires extensive fitting and pattern manipulation beyond most hobbyists' abiltiies.

However, most trans people did fit into their birth sex's sizes pre-transition, so trans proportions are no more inconsistent than cis ones. Current sewing resources and commercial sizing just weren't made for them!

If there were standard measurements and drafting methods that work for trans proportions, one could make sewing patterns (custom or ready-made) and create clothes that fit trans people as well as what cis people can expect from store-bought clothes.

> Ex. If I develop a drafting method and/or ready-made pattern for a transmasc suit, any transmasc with sewing skills (or access to someone else's sewing skills) could make a suit that fits them as well as what cis men can buy at the store.

This will not only be useful to trans people and their loved ones making them clothes at home, but also to anyone in fashion industry/clothing manufacturing who has trans clients.

> Ex. I need high-vis at work, but don't fit standard issue. Ill-fitting PPE is not regulation, so we need to get it custom made for me. Our supplier has meanwhile *LITERALLY GIVEN UP* as they can't provide the level of custom drafting required, so we will need to use a professional tailor instead.
If there was guidance for how to source custom PPE based on our precedent, other companies would have an easier time with it in future.
And if one could draft ready-made patterns for trans people, suppliers could even just have trans "standard issue" patterns on file for cases like this.

### Goal of the project

**The goal of this project is to enable easier access to well-fitting clothes for trans people who struggle to find clothes off-the-rack post-transition more so than they did pre-transition.**

These clothes should not only fit in the sense of accomodating shapes but also provide support with gendering, dignity, and, where applicable, safety.

The project aims to create:
- an anthropometry data set of relevant body measurements of post-transitional trans adults
- data-derived standard measurements and/or a grading chart that match trans proportions to be used in pattern drafting
- pattern drafting methods that work for trans measurements, and general guidance on pattern drafting for trans people (both in terms of fit and safeguarding)
- guidance aimed at employers on how to source custom-sized regulation-compliant PPE garments (ex. high vis) and other work wear/uniforms for trans workers

in an effort to fill and bridge current gaps in available anthropometry data, sewing resources, and industry suppliers' offerings between what is available for cis and trans people.

In doing so, it also hopes to demonstrate and establish an evidence base that these gaps currently exist, beyond informal community wisdom and individual cases. Key points to demonstrate and evidence are:
- Existing anthropometry studies/data sets do not cover, identify, and contextualise trans measurements adequately if at all.
- The average trans person's proportions differ notably from those of cis people of the opposite birth sex even post-transition, and they experience more fit issues because of this.
- Post-transition measurements also differ from those of unmodified people of the same birth sex.
- Existing pattern drafting methods that work for cis standard measurements do not work as intended when used on the average trans person's measurements.
- On average, trans people struggle more than cis people to acquire appropriately fitting clothes that are required for their job.

Ideally the data produced by this project will also be useful to other fields where body measurements make a difference and the differences in trans people's measurements are currently not accounted for, like f.e. calculating chest volume in cardiovascular science.

### Additional information

The scope of the project and its various parts is laid out in more detail in our [methodology document](methodology.md).

This project is **trans-led** and done with the express goal of improving trans people's quality of life.
All its **results** will be open access **published for free** for anyone to use. More information can be found in our [licensing document](license.md).

Currently we are not funded or institutionally/industrially backed, but I am working on that.

## Who is running this project?
<!-- about me -->

Hi! My name is Ren Zoller (@dkettchen). I'm a gender non-conforming trans man in my late 20s based in Manchester, UK. 

I was a femme-presenting nonbinary for about a decade and only started successfully being able to pass as male as recently as 2024 (5+ years into medical transition). 
With misgendering suddenly no longer being unavoidable, I had to actually seriously engage with men's fashion for the first time in my life.

As someone who has been obsessed with fashion and had no problem buying clothes I wanted off-the-rack most of my life, switching to men's fashion exclusively has been a very frustrating process (albeit worthwhile due to the no more misgendering).

- Men's fashion follows different rules and shape language than women's (ex. men's pant waist is in a fully different spot than women's), so most of my previous garments are useless to it.

- I don't fit standard men's sizes, so I can't just go to the store and buy new items that fit me, even from the limited selection available there.

- And even as a self-taught seamster making my own clothes, most sewing resources only cover women's fashion. 
Men's specific resources are highly limited (men only wear business pants and suit jackets, right??) and their methods often aren't very robust outside of using cis standard measurements (my measurements will literally break their dang clown math whenever I try to follow supposedly "bespoke" drafting methods).

I know I'm by far not the only trans person with this problem. So many of us (transmasc or transfemme) struggle to find clothing in the right size and shape, and I know notably a lot of transmascs are put off by the perceived lack of options among men's fashion.

I want to make fashion more accessible and fun for us again (*without* every last one of us having to essentially become a fully-qualified tailor about it).
This research project will form the foundation for that.

In my day job I work as a data engineer at Metrolink, and am a degree apprentice in data analysis at Manchester Metropolitan University. I also have a background in art/visual storytelling and trans community work/LGBT+ awareness training.

## What will the project entail?

### Trans anthropometry data and standard measurements

1) A survey asking relevant trans people to submit their measurements and answer some questions on their body and relation to standard sizing pre- and post-transition.
    - This survey is currently live at this link: https://tinyurl.com/Trans-Standard-Sizing
        - Any sharing is appreciated!
    - At a minimum it collects 14 required measurements and context data.
    - It will run as long as it needs to to get enough responses. 
        - For now I intend to keep it up until at least the end of 2026.
        - I would like a minimum of 50 responses per direction, but am hoping for more than that if possible.

2) Processing and analysing that data to determine trans standard measurements and gain other insights.
    - I will code custom software for this purpose, as I am a professional data engineer/analyst and have done data analysis projects of a similar scale before.

3) Pattern testing the measurements to make sure they fit as well as commercial sizing does for cis people.
    - This will rely on the trans drafting methods this project will develop and relevant fit models.

### Trans pattern drafting

<!-- This aspect of the project will be my entry to MMU's [Making Great Community Incubator 2026](https://rise.mmu.ac.uk/activity/making-great-community-incubator-2026/) in hopes of securing some mentoring from the uni's fashion department (ideally someone specialised in pattern cutting) and funding for material cost to make sample garments. -->

It will include:

1) Demonstrating that existing drafting methods are inadequate for trans measurements.

2) Developing measurement-based drafting methods that work for both trans and cis proportions.
    - should at least be able to draft a basic bodice and trouser block that are reasonably close to correct before further fitting.
    - I also want to make a method for making transmasc suits, as men's sewing resources are fewer and less robust to begin with, yet suits are important in men's fashion and currently inaccessible to most transmascs.

3) Producing sample garments using these drafting methods as a proof of concept.
    - These will also be useful to present the project at relevant tech/lgbt+/fashion/industry events.
    - Pictures of all final garments, ideally presented on a fit model or a trans-sized mannequin/dress form, will be included in the project data where possible.

#### Fit models
While we wait for the survey data, we will need trans measurements to use for this aspect of the project. Ideally we would use post-transitional fit models of average trans proportions, but other trans people may be of use too.

For transmasc "regular" sizing, I will use myself as the primary fit model, as I fit women's standard sizing very well pre-transition, suggesting I'm close to standard proportions, and I am of average afab height at 5'4". <!-- find a source for average height claim -->

For other transmasc categories, like plus-size, and for transfemme sizing, I will ask relevant friends and acquaintances to provide their measurements and allow me to fit on them.

### Trans PPE and work wear guidance

This aspect of the project will require the cooperation and support of Metrolink and other companies in the UK rail industry/transport sector.

It will include:

1) Documenting my own journey of getting custom-sized high-vis at my workplace, Metrolink.

2) Developing a recommended process for sourcing PPE/work wear/uniforms for trans workers in collaboration with other UK transport industry companies and the trans workers there-in.

3) Compiling a guidance resource detailing said process, providing information (including regulatory information where applicable) to pass along to the tailor, and giving recommendations for navigating things like transition timelines and gender non-conformity in relation to PPE and work wear, in line with the community's usual recommendations for gender diverse accessibility.

4) If possible, running a small survey in the local rail/transport companies to generate data-based evidence that trans workers struggle more to acquire work-required clothes that are gender appropriate and fit well enough than their cis peers, in order to strengthen the business case for using the guidance we will produce.

### Publishing the results

1) Publishing all our findings and results online for free for any member of the public to access and use.
    - This project is first and foremost for the public good of our community, so its results should be freely accessible to them.
    - This will enable people to share the project's resources and spread the word.
    - It will also empower community pattern makers and trans-allied or -led brands to make truly trans-inclusive products.
        - with better fit than they previously would've been able to without the data-driven foundation this project will provide.

2) Open Access Publishing all the project's data to make it easily available to other researchers and students.

3) Writing up the results in the appropriate format to publish them in relevant academic/industry/community outlets. 
    - This will help get the project taken seriously by academia and relevant industries, as it should be useful to them too, not just individuals in the trans community and its allies.
    - I want these to become the recommended methods for making and procuring trans-fitting clothes across fashion and other relevant industries like rail.

4) Sharing the guidance and resources via relevant organisations and events.
    - I hope to get our work wear guidance and possibly sewing resources added to various LGBT+ organisations' resource lists.
    - I hope to table at pride events and industry conferences to present our findings and sample garments, and share the resources with the community and employers in person, not just online.
