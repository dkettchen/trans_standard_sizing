## Resulting trans standard measurements and drafting methods

The final sewing resources themselves will be under a [Creative Commons BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

This means they can be used and built upon without having to share the results this openly (ex. if they are used commercially, people may not want to share their patterns etc for free if at all). They will only require attribution. 

I want people to use them as much as possible, so I don't want anyone to be put off by unneeded restrictions.
