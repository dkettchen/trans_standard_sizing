## You are invited to take part in this survey if you:
- are trans
- are at least 18 years old
- have been on HRT for at least the last 3 years 
    > (as meat changes (muscle/fat redistribution & transfemme breast growth) take ca 3-5 years to finalise)
- have not had your first puberty fully replaced 
    > (as that would prevent your bones from growing into the wrong hormones and causing these fit issues in the first place)

### Clarifications:
- While people who closely fit cis standard sizes pre-transition will be most interesting for checking that our trans sizes end up equivalent, I want to encourage anyone who qualifies by the above criteria to take part as we’re trying to capture the full range trans measurements can take.
- I also particularly want to encourage plus-sized people to take part, as I hope to also extract trans plus sizes from this data set!
- This project is label agnostic - I don’t care what you identify as or what pronouns you use. Nonbinary users can participate as long as they fit the above criteria.
- Can participate but will be asked to mark that specific so we’re aware of it when analysing the data later:
    - People on low-dose/other non-standard/custom HRT
    - People who were on HRT for the entire past 3 years, but changed their dose during that time
    - Transmascs who haven’t had top surgery
    - Transfemmes who have had mammoplasty
    - People who had surgery that would’ve changed other torso measurements (ex transfemmes who had their butt augmented, ex transmascs who had fat moved from one place to another)
