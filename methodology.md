# Vocab
**TRANS** = prefix that means "on opposite sides". People whose "true" gender does not align with their birth sex. For the purpose of this project: People who do not want to pass as their birth sex and, if able to, seek medical treatment to alter their sex characteristics accordingly <br>
**CIS** = prefix that means "on the same side"; the opposite of trans. People whose "true" gender aligns with their birth sex. For the purpose of this project: People who are content to physically pass as their birth sex and do not seek medical treatment to alter it

**AFAB** = assigned female at birth <br>
**AMAB** = assigned male at birth <br>
-> describes assigned gender role, but generally used as shorthand for physical birth sex it was based on

**TRANSMASC** = afab trans people <br>
**TRANSFEMME** = amab trans people <br>
-> describes transition direction

**GNC** = gender non-conforming <br>
**CROSSDRESSING** = wearing clothes of the opposite gender. For the purpose of this project: Following the opposite gendered fashion's shape language, whether one is trying to hide/fake sex characteristics (ex. drag) or not

**NONBINARY** = an ever-less-well-defined concept, generally involving some kind of androgyny and gender neutral language, including [pronoun sets other than plain she/her and he/him in english](https://github.com/dkettchen/gender_census_2024_data/blob/main/visualisation/charts/pronoun_pie.png), used by a variety of different types of gender diverse people for a variety of reasons, ranging from [queer and gnc cis people](https://github.com/dkettchen/gender_census_2024_data/blob/main/visualisation/charts/label_tickbox_non_trans_users.png), to [intersex people](https://github.com/dkettchen/gender_census_2024_data/blob/main/visualisation/charts/write_in_intersections.png), and [-most numerously- trans people](https://github.com/dkettchen/gender_census_2024_data/blob/main/visualisation/charts/label_tickbox_trans_cis_pie.png) (Gender Census 2024), with [afab people continuing to make up ~80% of users](https://github.com/dkettchen/us_trans_survey_data_vis/blob/main/vis_testing/total_survey_nb_distr.png) leading to [over half of transmascs using it compared to only 1/5th of transfemmes](https://github.com/dkettchen/us_trans_survey_data_vis/blob/main/vis_testing/survey_nb_distr.png) (US Transgender Survey 2015, 2022). <br>
~~Yes I have stats on this and yes I will link all of my charts, please enjoy.~~

**HRT** = hormone replacement therapy. In this context, specifically cross-sex hormone therapy

**TOP SURGERY** = double mastectomy (surgery to remove the vast majority of/all breast tissue) via double incision or keyhole/periareolar method - Most common surgery transmascs get. Also sometimes used on cis guys with gynecomastia
- DOUBLE INCISION = for average to bigger boobs, two horizontal cuts to remove excess skin. Nipples can either be grafted and repositioned or fully left out (some people get them tattooed on afterwards). Leaves two big horizontal scars under the pectoral area
- KEYHOLE/PERIAREOLAR = for very small boobs, reduces the skin via an incision around the nipple, leaving no significant visible scarring

**RADICAL REDUCTION** = an extreme breast reduction that removes as much breast tissue as possible with a breast reduction, usually leaving anchor-shaped scars (similar to top surgery except with a vertical line connecting big scar to nipple)

![](questionnaire_images/transmasc_measurements/transmasc_scars.png)

**MAMMOPLASTY** = breast augmentation surgery

**BOTTOM SURGERY** = gender reassignment surgery, can include any trans surgery on genitals/the reproductive system (ex. phalloplasty, metoidioplasty, hysterectomy, vaginaplasty, labiaplasty, orchiectomy, etc)

**BINDING** = to flatten, compress, and shape boobs to look more like pecs using a "binder" (a garment with a front panel of more rigid fabric), a compressing sports bra (only works for smaller breasts), or sometimes binding tape <br>
**PACKING** = to simulate junk volume via a "packer", which can be anything from some socks to a full fake penis <br>
**TUCKING** = to tuck away junk to get rid of crotch volume, sometimes achieved using tucking tape or special underwear

# Project at large
## Guiding principles
<!-- copied from README, figure out how you want to organise -->
1) Being trans is a temporal phenomenon
    - Trans people go through different phases over time, where they have different needs, priorities, circumstances, and anatomy. No single standard can cater to all of them and not all of them have this issue (yet) to begin with.
    - Transition is temporary. (Ideally) most trans people's (out) lives will be spent in their end-state, not an inbetween stage.

2) Sustainable fashion
    - You should invest in clothes that will last you a long time, not in clothes highly customised to a temporary body and circumstance that won't fit you in a few years.
    - Your clothes should fit other people (if possible) so you can sell/donate them as second-hand once you're not using them anymore.

3) Passing safety
    - Once misgendering as one's birth sex is avoidable, not getting misgendered is the healthiest option for trans people's wellbeing.
    - Gendered fashion helps with correct gendering by constructing clear(er) gendered shape language with clothes.

## Priorities
Trans standard sizing should:

- look best on people who are (as) physically post-transition (as possible) and actively trying not to get misgendered as their birth sex.
    - Their body won't change (more than anyone else's) anymore.
    - They are most in need of appropriately fitting target gender fashion.
- expect the medical interventions people of the relevant direction usually get
    - Ex. Most transmascs (eventually) get top surgery and if they (voluntarily) forgo it it's usually because they only had a small amount of breast tissue to begin with, so transmasc sizing should suppose flat(ter) chests, same as cis-male fashion.
- secondarily fit better than cis-sized options on the following groups as most of our fit issues arise from bones as shaped by first puberty:
    - people pre- and early-transition already
    - people on lower doses of HRT
    - relevant crossdressing cis people (ex. crossplayers)
- match men's and women's fashion respectively in its designs to give their wearer the best shot at not being misgendered as their birth sex
    - Ex. Suitwear for transfemmes should strictly adhere to women's fashion shape language to assure it clearly reads as women's suitwear and does not get them misgendered as men.
- cater to what measurements and information are needed to draft those garments
    - Ex. Women's fashion needs more intricate chest measurements, so transfemme measurements should include those.

## Scope

### Of clothing items

This project aims to address fit issues and lack of coverage in commercially available clothes as experienced by trans people who completed (enough of) their natural first puberty (resulting in bones of significantly different proportions than their cis peers) and remain even if they get all the treatment that is currently medically possible (i.e. not covering any fit issues caused by lack or voluntary refusal of treatment, like pre-/non-op genitals or (transmasc) boobs).

This means it excludes:
- Anything that isn't gender-specific to begin with or can reasonably still be bought in birth sex aisle post-transition
    - Accessories
        - Ex. A scarf is one-size and not fitted to any sex characteristics
    - Head-, hand- and footwear
        - Ex. Sneakers are sneakers, regardless of whether you buy them in a men's or women's size.
    - Underwear that is shaped for pre-/non-op genitals (or other body parts) without re-shaping them
        - Ex. I have gotten over myself and decided to just buy women's underwear until bottom surgery because it's so much easier to go to a shop and buy a 5-pack of whatever has the most coverage than trying to replace too-tight elastic waistbands on men's underwear that doesn't fit right anyway even after that alteration.
- Anything that is already commercially available in specialist shops or could be drafted using existing cis patterns
    - Anything specifically catering to managing pre-/non-op anatomy
        - Binders
        - Tucking underwear
        - Packing underwear
    - Anything that is purely a style issue
        - Femme underwear that can accomodate junk
        - Masc underwear that doesn't have extra space for junk
- Anything that isn't "normal clothes" a cis person could buy at a regular clothing store
    - Fursuits (as that's in the same category as like mascot costumes, not normal clothes)
    - Fetish/kink-specific items (as those wouldn't be available at a regular clothing store)
        - If "normal" garments are used for fetish/kink purposes (ex. leather daddy vests and pants, lolita dresses, lacy underwear, corsetry, etc), they are not fetish/kink-*specific*, as their pattern would be the same as that of the regular version.

### Of demographic representation
This dataset will not be representative of the entire global trans and gender diverse community.
- Some subsets of the community are excluded by default from the survey, due to age, transition state, certain disabilities, or having transitioned so early that they would've developed cis-typical proportions.
- Others will have less stake in the issue we're trying to address and therefore be less likely to respond than those who do.
- The survey is in english, meaning most of its respondants will be from the english-speaking world, scewing not only country of origin and language/cultural background, but also racial distribution towards that. 
- In countries where being out let alone accessing trans healthcare is less feasible, people will also be less likely to be at the transition stage we require, meaning even if we did have a less scewed distribution of respondants' countries of origin, certain countries (and the associated racial distribution) would still be much more underrepresented than others.
- The survey will also have an easier time spreading on the internet, meaning it'll scew our age distribution heavily towards younger people, and favour people with relevant internet/technology access and skills.

We are not tracking data points like location, race, socio-economic background, or gender labels/pronouns, so their bias won't be able to be properly quantified. 

Due to how uncontrollably things can spread online and through the community, it is also hard to specifically target certain sub-groups beyond encouraging them to participate and share when they see it. The best I believe I can do is:
- share the survey through as many different avenues as I can access (ex. through charities, in person flyers, posting on a variety of websites/social media that have different core demographics (older, more afabs, more amabs, more racial diversity than others), etc)
- ask transfemmes to make sure to participate after the first wave of responses, as I expect a likely transmasc majority from posting the survey on tumblr and my theory that transmascs have more trouble with finding fitting clothes post-transition (to be confirmed once we have the data set innit)

We are assuming that these things do not impact general proportions significantly enough to be relevant to our aim of producing trans standard measurements.
- Ex. While there can be differences between different countries' sizing systems (ex. Asian sizes being smaller than western ones), in racially-diverse countries clothing sizes are not separated by race (ex. You don't have white sizing, black sizing, asian sizing, etc in the US ~~(I assume. I've never been over there, but I feel like we would've heard about it if that was the case, I don't think their neo-nazi politicians et al. have gone *quite that far* with their racism (in practice) yet 👀'~~)).
    - If commercial cis sizes don't bother to differentiate between races, I don't see why a significantly more niche standard should bother to assess that dimension beyond *not excluding anyone* based on it. 
    <!-- TODO add source abt that 1930s study that excluded PoC from their data set for no good reason smh -->
- Ex. While there may be differences in say weight between people from different socio-economic backgrounds for a variety of reasons, someone say plus-sized will be within the same range of proportions as other plus-sized people, regardless of which background they're from. 
    - Our ability to assess what proportions someone of that size generally has will not be hampered by not knowing their class or how class relates to their size.

### Of physical body types
This project aims to address gaps in commercially available clothes and enable pattern drafting.

This means it is only interested in being able to group respondants by commercially available categories (ex. plus-size, extra tall, petit(e)) and by aspects known to require special pattern drafting considerations (ex. muscularity, age).

Its scope excludes:
- Transfemme muscularity, as most transfemmes this far into HRT won't have a significant enough amount of muscle mass to mess with pattern drafting the way it may for highly muscular transmascs
    - E doesn't let you build as much muscle as T -> Even though women can get quite big with muscle, this is much rarer than it is for people on T, even among very fit cis women.
    - Most transfemmes are actively trying not to be too muscular for dysphoria, passing, and transphobic harassment reasons.
    - Transfemme muscle mass is a data point I do not see the relevance of outside of sports science, and this is a project about fashion for trans people, not about trans people in sport (sportswear not withholding).
- Whether or not people are intersex
    - Intersex is an umbrella term for like 40 wildly different conditions, with very different anatomy.
        - Some intersex people will have gone through a different medical pathway/be more limited in their trans medical options than non-intersex trans people due to their condition
            - This means they may not fit neatly into our categories of transmasc and transfemme, and may not be able to accurately answer all our questions, if they are able to qualify to begin with.
        - Meanwhile other intersex people will be close enough to the non-intersex trans body types to participate just fine
    - I am not excluding people based on being intersex, nor tracking whether they are, due to this wide range of experiences where some qualify and some don't. 
        - I hope the ones who qualify participate, and those who don't will understand as much from the questions they're unable to answer correctly and quit out before completing the survey.
        - Some intersex people also just straight up don't know they're intersex (although any trans ones this far into HRT should've figured it out by now with their endocrinologists), so may not be able to answer correctly even if we were to ask about it.
    - Even if intersex people participate and answer questions in a way that doesn't align with our assumptions (ex. Have you had hysterectomy/your testes removed respectively? No. -> Does that mean you still have your gamedes or that you never had any to begin with?), there should be few enough of them that it won't scew the overall sample.
        - Ex. In the biggest-to-date year for the Gender Census (2024), [only about 200 out of the 48,000 respondants wrote in that they were intersex](https://github.com/dkettchen/gender_census_2024_data/blob/main/visualisation/charts/write_in_intersections.png). Meanwhile [over half identified themselves as trans](https://github.com/dkettchen/gender_census_2024_data/blob/main/visualisation/charts/label_tickbox_trans_cis_pie.png).
- Anything more intricate, less standardised, and/or less easy to determine for the average respondant
    - Ex. Body shape categories named after fruit and whatnot. 🍎🍐⏳

### In conclusion

We are aiming to determine general proportions of trans people.
- Even if the final trans standard measurements are slightly off for certain people due to these omissions, they will still provide a better basis for trans-sized pattern drafting than cis standard measurements/cis-sized patterns would be able to.

# Survey
## Guiding principles
1) Label agnosticism
    - This study is about physical bodies, not language.
    - People's choices on transition specifics are not tied to their labels.
        - Ex. "binary" trans people may choose to forgo certain treatments.
        - Ex. "nonbinary" trans people may get the same treatment as binary peers.
    - People of the same transition direction share starter set and medical options, and therefore should be grouped together.

2) Safeguarding
    - One needs to be mindful of dysphoria when dealing with trans participants.
    - Our respondants will be less vulnerable than people fully pre-transition due to their HRT, but still include people who haven't concluded their treatment (ex. transmasc pre-top surgery).
    - Those most in need of accomodations to comfortably complete the measurements will be prioritised.

3) Reasonable thoroughness
    - We won't be able to follow up with the respondants after the survey, so it should include anything we might reasonably want/need info on down the line.
    - Measurements collected should cover any that could be needed for pattern drafting.
    - Context data collected should be relevant to drafting considerations, enable grouping by relevant groups and give insight into relevant fit issues.

## Context data collected

- Should give a picture of the respondant's body type category and shapes to facilitate grouping by them
    - Ex. Specify commercially available special categories like plus-size or unconventional heights.
    - Ex. Specify factors, like age or muscularity, that can impact what pattern drafting considerations are needed.
- Should not pry more than needed, for data protection/privacy reasons
    - Ex. Not asking for unnecessary data points like location, race, identity labels, pronouns, contact details, full names, etc.
    - Ex. Not asking for more transition specifics than relevant for shapes/measurements.
        - Ex. It doesn't matter if someone had transmasc bottom surgery or habitually packs, as they will have extra crotch volume to clothe either way.
- Should give a relevant idea of the respondant's proportion compared to standard sizing
    - Ex. How well did it fit pre-transition and what size that was?
    - Ex. What fit issues do they currently experience?

## Measurements collected

### Priorities

- This project primarily aims to address contemporary everyday wear needs, not historical styles.
    - Any measurements specific to historical styles not relevant to modern ones are excluded from the initial survey. 
        - Ex. the "dress" measurement of men's fashion that describes the amount of extra space to leave for junk, which is omitted in most contemporary men's wear due to underwear that keeps the junk closer to the body
    - If people want to draft historical styles for trans people, they can measure their fit model(s) for any missing measurements and grade the resulting pattern using our proportional insights.

- It also aims to help relevant trans people with passing, meaning measurements needed for the respective gendered fashion's core styles will be prioritised over more fringe measurements. 
    - Ex. Transmasc suitwear is more important to have the measurements for than say transmasc corsetry.

### Trans specific considerations
These measurements should:
- be aware of the post-transitional body types we're dealing with
    - Ex. Anyone who's been on E for 3+ years will have grown some amount of breast tissue, so may need a bra and should be able to provide boob measurements.
    - Ex. Anyone who's had double incision top surgery will have big horizontal chest scars, so may want to show them off and should be able to provide scar measurements.
- not pry more than needed, for dysphoria safeguarding reasons
    - Ex. Chest measurements should be optional for transmascs who haven't had top surgery.
    - Ex. Crotch measurements should be kept to a minimum.

### Enabling passing safety, gnc-ity, as well as community-- *ahem* creativity beyond that
These measurements should:
- meet the needs of the relevant gendered fashion in order to help people pass and dress appropriately
    - Ex. Suitwear is a core style of men's fashion, and the expected formal wear for men, so transmascs need accessible suitwear and should provide suitwear measurements.
    - Ex. Women's fashion includes bras and likes to accentuate boobs, so transfemmes should provide sufficiently intricate chest/boob measurements.
- enable any pattern drafting people want to get up to beyond that, without normative assumptions
    - Ex. Allowing anyone to provide suit measurements to enable suitwear for transfemmes.
    - Ex. Allowing anyone to provide underbust measurements to enable more fitted garments (ex. corsetry) for transmascs.
    - Ex. Recording both waistlines for everyone in case people want to crossdress and get themselves misgendered for any reason. (*There are valid reasons for this*, like drag/costuming, or living out of role while unable to pass (I did the latter for a decade until well into medical transition, so rest assured I do not say this with snide or judgement, I just don't recommend it past when it is absolutely necessary, for your own sanity, and I do not plan to enable it in my own pattern drafting)).
