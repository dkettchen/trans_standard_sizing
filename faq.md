# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why can't trans people just continue wearing clothes from their birth sex aisle to mitigate fit issues in the other aisle?

Because that's not how gendered fashion works unfortunately!
- Men's and women's fashion not only differ in literal size and (bone-related) proportion, but also both in styling/created shape language/proportion and in literal body fit
    - Ex. Men's fashion's uses the upper hip as its standard waistline, while women's fashion uses the natural waist. This is also reflected in the length of upper garments.
    - Ex. Women's fashion provides space for boobs that men's doesn't.
- In the case of trans people these things still hold true
    - Ex. A transmasc still needs pants that sit on his upper hip, not his natural waist, and for afab people the hip tends to be a much bigger measurement than their waist, meaning appropriately-sized women's wear, which is cut for the smaller natural waist, cannot simply be worn on the upper hip.
    - Ex. A transfemme still needs space for her boobs that men's fashion doesn't provide.
- Even where for cis people, switching between aisles can work, it may not for trans people.
    - Ex. A cis woman may be able to wear pants from the men's aisle, because she wears them on her natural waist, which may be a similar circumference as the cis-male hips they were made for. 
    
        Similarly a cis man may be able to wear pants from the women's aisle because there is less of a difference between his narrow waist and hip measurements, so it doesn't matter which one he wears them on. 

        However neither men's nor women's pants of the length appropriate to an equivalent transmasc would have a wide enough waist to fit their upper hip.
- For a lot of trans people a base amount of gender conformity is also relied upon for passing, so they may not be able to find the styles they need in their birth sex's aisle
    - Ex. A transfemme may need a dress to help her pass, but the men's aisle doesn't have dresses.
