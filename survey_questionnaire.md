[confirm and start survey] -->

### First you will be asked some specifics about yourself/your body.

**What is your transition direction (based on birthsex)?** (as we’ll need to check for different things for each)
- Transmasc (afab trans people, FtM, FtX)
- Transfemme (amab trans people, MtF, MtX)

|  <div style="width:40vw">transmasc</div>	| <div style="width:40vw">transfemme</div> | 
|-|-|
| **Have you had top surgery** (double masectomy via double incision or keyhole and masc chest reconstruction) **or a radical chest reduction** (removing the vast majority of your breast tissue without severing the tubes)? - y/n | **Have you had mammoplasty** (augmenting boob job with implants or fat grafts)? - y/n | 
| **Have you had a hysterectomy?** - y/n |  |
| **Are you generally working with more-than-naturally-available-to-you crotch-volume either via (external) bottom surgery or habitual packing?** - y/n | **Are you generally working with crotch-volume similar to that of cis women either via bottom surgery or habitual (successful) tucking?** - y/n | 
| **Have you had any surgery that changed any of your other torso measurements?** (ex. surgical lipo redistribution) - y/n | **Have you had any surgery that changed any of your other torso measurements?** (ex. butt augmentation) - y/n | 
| **Are you on a full/standard dose of testosterone?** - y/n | **Are you on a full/standard dose of estrogen AND either on T-blockers or have had surgery that removes the testes?** - y/n | 
| **If no please specify:** (can select multiple) | **If no please specify:** (can select multiple) | 
| - low dose T (ex. half dose) | - low dose E | 
| - anything else | - neither blockers nor surgery | 
| | - anything else | 
| | **Are you on progesterone?** - y/n | 

**Have you been on your current HRT dose/mix consistently for the entirety of the past 3 years?** - y/n

- **If you changed dose/mix in the past 3 years, how long have you been on your current dose/mix?** 
    - <1 year
    - 1-2 years
    - 2+ years

**How long have you been on HRT** (any dose/mix, without major breaks)?
- 3-5 years
- 5-10 years
- 10+ years

**What is your age group?**
- 18-29
- 30-39
- 40-49
- 50-59
- 60-69
- 70+

### You will now be asked to take your measurements. 

Make sure you have a measuring tape (or similar) to hand, and maybe a loved one to help you. (You should be able to measure all the core measurements yourself if needed.)

**Please indicate the unit you’ll be measuring in:**

- cm [default to cm]
- inches
<!-- we'll have to check for realistic measurements in data cleaning in case anyone messed this up -->

**Actual measurements:**
<!-- (TODO look up which measurements we need for each direction & instructions for them) -->

base measurements everyone will need to fill out
- height
- shoulder height (or like collar bone or smth) (TODO look up)
- neck (TODO look up)
- shoulder
- arm measurements (TODO look up)
- natural waist
- upper hip/male pants waist
- (various distances between things I’m assuming, TODO look up)
- inseam from near crotch bone (-> genital independant)
- outseam from male pant waist
- outseam from natural waist
    - both outseams for both directions so we can later compare to cis measurements better
- rise to natural waist

| (optional) measurements for scar placement if anyone wants to design scar-show-off garments based on average | | |


### You will now be asked some questions about your relationship to standard sizing/off-the-rack fashion pre- and post-transition.

**What size(s) did you wear/fit you when buying clothes in your birthsex’s aisle pre-transition?** 
(select up to 3)

<!-- TODO look up sizing systems & find their corresponding standard measurements if possible -->
- [sizing system] [size]
- [sizing system] [size] (optional)
- [sizing system] [size] (optional)
    <!-- - there will be an option to input custom sizing system & size if it’s not one of the options available
        - should also include existing sizing systems w extreme sizes I may have omitted
        - -> these will include special sizes where at all possible (ie plenty of XLs)
        - include pants sizing bc I know that can be weird w the two measurements -->
- I never shopped in my birthsex’s aisle pre-transition/I never shopped in adult sizes pre-transition/I never wore store-bought clothes pre-transition
- I don’t know/remember my size pre-transition

**Did you pre-transition and/or do you currently consider yourself any of the following “special” categories?**
(F.e. I would consider myself short by cis male standards, but I am very much average height for a transmasc/afab person)

| <div style="width:20vw">category</div>  | <div style="width:20vw">pre-transition</div> |  <div style="width:20vw">now (compared to cis standards)</div> | <div style="width:20vw">now (compared to trans standards)</div> |
|-|-|-|-|
| plus size | l| l| |
| extra tall   | l| l| l|
| extra short/small/petit(e) | l| l| l|

|  <div style="width:40vw">transmasc</div>	| <div style="width:40vw">transfemme</div> | 
|-|-|
| **Would you consider yourself very muscular to the point that it may cause fit issues notably in tailored/non-stretch garments like suitwear?** (ex. like it can for say professional athletes or bodybuilders) - y/n	| | 

**How well did standard sizing (in your birthsex’s aisle) fit you pre-transition (in terms of physical body fit, not style/gender expression)?**
- very well, I could easily find clothes off-the-rack that fit me in most shops
- somewhat well, I could usually find clothes off-the-rack, but experienced certain fit issues (ex. wrong length, ex. wrong chest size, etc)
- poorly, so I had to use specialist shops/sections (plus size, extra tall, etc), but could easily find clothes there
- poorly, so I had to use specialist shops/sections (plus size, extra tall, etc), but still experienced certain fit issues there (ex. wrong length, ex. wrong chest size, etc)
- very poorly, I’ve never had properly fitting clothes/I needed custom tailoring to have any clothes that fit correctly
- not applicable 
    > (ex. I didn’t shop in birthsex aisle, ex. I only wore homemade clothes, etc)

**How has medical transition and shopping in the other aisle changed your relationship to standard sizing (in terms of physical body fit, not style/gender expression)?**
- for the better, I can find clothes off-the-rack that fit me properly more easily than before for most garment types
- neutrally, I can find clothes off-the-rack about as easily/rarely as before and/or there has been an equal trade-off of some kind
- for the worse, it has become much harder to find clothes off-the-rack that fit me properly for most garment types
- not applicable 
    > (ex. I don’t shop off-the-rack, ex. I still exclusively shop in birthsex aisle, ex. I don’t adhere to other aisle’s way of styling garments even when I shop there (ex. transmascs wearing men’s aisle pants on their natural waist), etc)

**What are your most common fit issues with standard sizing (in your target gender’s/opposite of birthsex’s aisle)?**

[select any that apply (can leave all empty)]

### Some final (optional) questions

**(optional) While I have you here: I will be using these measurements to make sewing patterns for people to use, so if you can think of any types of clothes you can never seem to find in your size due to trans-related fit issues but would be particularly useful or just nice to have, please list them here**
[enter up to 3]

- Please keep suggestions short (ex. “trousers”, ex. “button-up shirt”, ex. “bra”)
- You can specify basic styles if you want (ex. “a cute oversized sweater”, ex. “a double-breasted suit”, ex. “a lolita dress”, ex. “a bomber jacket”)
- Suggestions can include work wear/uniforms (ex. "scrubs for work", ex. "high vis for work")
- Please stick to regular clothes (ex. something the average cis person can just find at a store, ex. what you might wear in your everyday/to a wedding/to chill at home/to the office/to a date/to pride/to subculture events/etc) 
- Anything else (ex. shoes/hats/accessories, trans-specialist underwear, fursuits, fetish/kink-specific items, etc) is outside of the scope of this project

-> Like what’s your craziest, not-actually-that-crazy fashion wish that cis sizes are currently standing in the way of?

**(optional) Do you know me in person?** [y/n/unsure]

This is to be able to reidentify the measurements of any of my friends & acquaintances that I may be pattern testing on/making sample garments for, so we don’t have to retake their measurements later. 

- ***This will not be part of the final published data set, this is just for my own reference.***
- “Knowing me in person” includes people who have been in GI/Spectra/etc online groups with me during the pandemic even if they have not met me “in person”
- If you don't know me, please do not be a parasocial weirdo who'd lie on this question, I block any strangers who message me.

<!-- only appears if you've selected y on previous question -->
**(optional) If so, if you are 1) UK-based and 2) willing to be one of my fit models, please enter your first name here.** (no worries if not)
[field to enter a name]

- Note: Even if you volunteer as a fit model here, that does not guarantee you'll be used as one. (It's nothing personal, I just know a lot of people and will ultimately only need a handful for this.) On the flip-side this also means there's no obligation to be a fit model even if you put your name here and change your mind later!
- For pattern testing I’m particularly interested in fitting on anyone Manchester/North West based (to make meeting up easier) and anyone in our “special” size categories regardless of location (as I wanna get those right and can’t fit them on myself).
- Down the line I’ll also need some models for events and photoshoots that can be based elsewhere (ex. London friends) and that I want to include a diverse/representative range of looks beyond just fit (explicitly inviting any friends who are f.e. POC, 40+, etc).
- If we’ve not been in touch for a while and/or I don’t have you on any socials, feel free to message me on insta or discord or something (I’m @dkettchen on everything) or email me at dkettchen@gmail.com - notably if you’d fit the pattern testing criteria above!
