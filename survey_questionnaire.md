| **Chest circumference** 📌 <br>The widest part of your chest ![](questionnaire_images\transmasc_measurements\transmasc_chest_circumference.png) | All chest measurements in this section and beyond, other than the underbust measurement, are optional for you, please do not feel obliged if you struggle or do not feel comfortable with any of them. | These will include a bunch of intricate bust measurements used for drafting bras and determining bra size using tools like [ABraThatFits' bra size calculator](https://www.abrathatfits.org/calculator.php). <br><br> Please take these measurements without a bra on if possible. If that is not possible, please wear a well-fitting, non-padded bra or bralette. <br><br> For any single-boob measurements, please measure on the same boob for all of them. If you're very asymmetrical, you can measure both sides and put in the average if you prefer. <br><br> If you've had one boob removed or reduced for say cancer reasons, use the other one. <br><br> If you've had both boobs fully removed for androgynous or cancer reasons, feel free to leave out the optional bra-specific measurements entirely. |

## <!-- co-ed measurements -->

(Welcome back everyone, this concludes the transmasc-/transfemme-specific parts of the questionnaire, you'll be co-ed for the rest of it 👍)

You should **wear the undergarments you usually wear** under clothes to take these measurements. <br>
If you habitually **tuck/pack/bind**, please make sure you do so before you take the measurements.

### **Hand circumference** 📌
Widest part of hand (while holding it the way you would put it through a sleeve).  

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\hand.png)

### **Armscye measurements**
These next few measurements will help us draft the shoulder/sleeve seam or armhole in clothes. <br><br> Please put your ruler (or other equivalent implement) under your armpit for these measurements, and position it as horizontally as you can (touching whatever the lowest point of your armpit is when arm down).

### **Armhole height** 📌 (front)
Measure from the shoulder point (we used for shoulder/arm measurements before) down to the top of the ruler in the front. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\armscye_height_front.png)

Measure from the shoulder point down to the level of the top of the ruler on the side of your arm. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\armscye_height_side.png)

### **Armpit distance** 📌
Measure the distance between the front and back points on the ruler you just measured to/where the ruler sticks out from your arm on either side. <br><br> **After this** measurement you can **remove the ruler** from your armpit. Please **mark** with a pin on your clothes (or a pen/pencil on your skin if you're doing this shirtless) where the top of the ruler was on the side of your body. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\armscye_depth.png)

### **Front width** 📌
The distance between the armscye seams (the line we just measured with the ruler)/where your arms connect to your body in the front. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\front_width.png)

### **Back width**
Same measurement but in the back.

(If you couldn't find anyone to help you measure and cannot reach this properly yourself, please skip it.)

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\back_width.png)

### **Shoulder width** (back) 📌
The distance between your shoulder points (where you can feel bone from earlier) in the back. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\shoulder_width.png)

### **Shoulder width** (front) 📌
Same measurement but in the front. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\shoulder_width_front.png)

### **Clavicle to shoulder point distance** 📌

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\clavicle_to_shoulder_point.png)

### **Natural waist circumference** 📌
Your natural waist is located somewhere between your ribcage and hip bone. <br><br> For some people it'll be the smallest part of their torso to form a more or less pronounced indent/"hourglass" shape. <br> For anyone else: see where your elbow creases, your torso bends, or your back curves in. <br><br> Once you've found your natural waist, you may want to mark it by tying some string around it or similar as we'll need it again in a minute for other measurements. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\nat_waist.png)

### **Front (natural) waist**
(optional, but recommended for anyone with a relevant amount of belly fat as this may make your front measurement bigger than the back) <br><br> The front "half" of your waist line (to where your side seams will be). 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\front_waist.png)

### **Distance from clavicle to natural waist** (front) 📌
From the centerpoint of your collarbones, against your sternum down the middle of your rib cage and belly. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\clavicle_to_nat_waist.png)

### **Distance from clavicle to natural waist** (front, with ruler)
(**required for transfemmes**, optional for transmascs (recommended if you have chest volume (you are comfy with and intend to keep))) <br><br> Place your ruler across your boobs/chest and measure from your clavicle to natural waist over the ruler-bridge. <br><br> (If you're transmasc and the ruler is touching your sternum or very close to it, skip this measurement.) 

![](questionnaire_images\transfemme_measurements\transfemme_clavicle_to_nat_waist_ruler.png)

### **Side seam to natural waist** 📌
The distance between bottom-of-armscye pin and natural waist. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\sideseam.png)

### **Nipple/bust point distance**
(**required for transfemmes**, optional for transmascs (recommended if you have chest volume (you are comfy with and intend to keep))) <br><br> Distance between your nipples/bust points*. <br><br> * The bust point is the apex of your boob/moob/pec. Even for cis men and people who've had mastectomy, most people's chests aren't actually flat, so they still have apexes. <br> For most women/people with unaltered boobs, their bust point aligns with their nipples. However transmascs, with their binder squish and at times messy and/or nippleless top surgery results, can't always rely on their nipples to determine their apex (see illustration below this question). 

![](questionnaire_images\transfemme_measurements\transfemme_bust_point_distance.png)

#### **Determining transmasc bust point via apex examples:**
(if you have strangely placed/no nipples and are too flat for this method or otherwise struggle to determine your bust points, don't worry about it, just skip the bust point measurements, as again, they're optional for transmascs) 

![](questionnaire_images\transmasc_measurements\transmasc_bust_points_via_apex.png)

### **Distance from shoulder to natural waist** (front) 📌
From the middle of your shoulder down to your natural waist. <br><br> Please measure across nipple/bust point where relevant*. <br><br> * If you are transmasc and super flat, feel free to just measure straight down, ignoring nipple/bust point, and skip the next two measurements entirely. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\shoulder_to_nat_waist.png)

### **Distance from nipple/bust point to natural waist**
(**required for transfemmes**, optional for transmascs (recommended if you have chest volume (you are comfy with and intend to keep) and/or measured across bust point for the previous question)) 

![](questionnaire_images\transfemme_measurements\transfemme_bust_point_to_nat_waist.png)

### **Distance from underbust to natural waist**
(required for transfemmes, optional for transmascs) <br><br> From the lowest point of your boob/moob/pec down. 

![](questionnaire_images\transfemme_measurements\transfemme_underbust_to_nat_waist.png)

### **Shoulder to natural waist** (diagonal, front) 📌
From your shoulder point (from earlier) to the front middle of your natural waist. <br><br> Where relevant please measure this across nipple/bust point. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\diagonal_shoulder_to_nat_waist.png)

### **Shoulder to natural waist** (diagonal, back) 📌
Same measurement in the back. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\diagonal_shoulder_to_nat_waist_back.png)

### **Distance from nape of the neck to natural waist** (back) 📌
Follow your back's shape. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\nape_to_nat_waist.png)

### **Distance from shoulder to natural waist** (back) 📌
From the middle of your shoulder down. Follow your back's shape. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\shoulder_to_nat_waist_back.png)

### **Nape of the neck to end of ribcage/sternum**
(**required for transmascs**, optional for transfemmes <br><br> These next few measurements are used for drafting waistcoats and suit jackets.) <br><br> From the middle back of your neck to the middle bottom of your ribcage. <br><br> If you put your ruler on your chest earlier to make the bridge, please do this here as well. 

![](questionnaire_images\transmasc_measurements\vest_to_sternum.png)

### **End of ribcage/sternum to natural waist**
(**required for transmascs**, optional for transfemmes) <br><br> From the previous measurement's end-point straight down to your natural waist. 

![](questionnaire_images\transmasc_measurements\vest_sternum_to_nat_waist.png)

### **Nape of the neck to front natural waist**
(**required for transmascs**, optional for transfemmes) <br><br> From the middle back of your neck to the middle of your natural waist. <br><br> If you put your ruler on your chest earlier to make the bridge, please do this here as well. 

![](questionnaire_images\transmasc_measurements\vest_to_nat_waist.png)

### **High hip/low waist circumference** 📌
Where you can feel the upper bit of your hip bone. <br><br> You may want to mark this with string. <br><br> If you have a big belly, this may dip down more in the front to follow the belly's shape, please measure and mark it accordingly. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\high_hip.png)

### **Front (low) waist**
(optional, but highly recommended for any transmascs with a relevant amount of belly fat (including if you just have a gut) as this may make your front measurement bigger than the back and men's fashion uses the high hip/low waist as its waistline) <br><br> The front "half" of your low waist line (to where your side seams will be). Follow your curve if any. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\front_low_waist.png)

### **Natural waist to high hip/low waist distance** (front) 📌
The distance between the two lines you've (hopefully) marked, along the front middle of your body. <br> You can also measure from your clavicle to your high hip line and substract the clavicle to natural waist distance from that. <br><br> These measurements are notably important for transmascs as men's fashion uses the high hip as its standard waistline and we'll need this to determine the whole distance to that "male waist" using the natural waist distances. **If you're transmasc, please make extra sure these measurements are accurate.** 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\nat_waist_to_high_hip_front.png)

### **Natural waist to high hip distance** (side) 📌
Same measurement, along the side of your body. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\nat_waist_to_high_hip_side.png)

### **Natural waist to high hip distance** (back) 📌
Same measurement, along the back middle of your body. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\nat_waist_to_high_hip_back.png)

### **Fly length** (from natural waist)
(optional, but recommended for transmascs) <br><br> From your natural waist to where your crotch starts to curve in*. <br><br> Please make sure your crotch is in the state it is usually in re underwear and potential tucking/packing. <br><br> * *The actual crotch.* If your belly makes a slope before that, please ignore that and measure all the way to the bottom where it makes a sharper curve (regardless of genitals) to go inbetween your legs. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\fly.png)

### **Rise to natural waist** 📌
Sit down somewhere (on a hard-ish surface), sit upright, and measure the height from the seat's surface to your natural waist, along the side of your body. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\rise.png)

### **Crotch depth** 📌
Measure from front natural waist to back natural waist through the middle inbetween your legs. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\crotch_depth.png)

### **Outseam from natural waist** (side) 📌
Standing up, hold the measuring tape to the side of your natural waist, letting it hang straight down along your leg, and measure down to the floor. <br><br> If you can't stand at all, please take this lying down and measure along the side of your leg to your ankle, then sit with your foot on the floor and measure up to your ankle from the floor and add the two together to enter here. 

![](questionnaire_images\coed_measurements\outseam_to_nat_waist.png)

## **You will now be asked some questions about your relationship to standard sizing/off-the-rack fashion pre- and post-transition.**

### **Did you buy clothes in your birthsex’s aisle pre-transition and if so do you remember your size(s)?** 📌 

| ⚪ Yes | ⚪ I never shopped in my birthsex's aisle/adult sizes/clothing stores pre-transition <br> ⚪ I don’t know/remember my size pre-transition |
|-|-|
| **What size(s) did you wear/fit you best when buying clothes in your birthsex’s aisle pre-transition?** <br> (Enter 1 to 3 sizes) | |
| **1) Select a sizing system** 📌 <br> Notes: <br> - Some regions share sizing systems with other regions. If you believe your sizing system is the same as one listed here even if it's not named after your region, feel free to select it anyway. <br> - If you're unsure, can't find your sizing system, or were using a different system of one of these regions (as some have multiple), select "A sizing system not listed here" and enter it below. | |

### **Did you pre-transition and/or do you currently consider yourself plus size?**
(If you've never been plus size, skip this question)

⬜ Pre-transition <br>⬜ Now

### **Do you consider yourself to be an unusual height?**
Ex. I would consider myself short compared to cis men but am very much average height for a transmasc.

| | By cis standards | By trans standards |
|-|-|-|
| Extra tall | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Extra short/small/petit(e) | ⬜ | ⬜ |

### **How well did standard sizing (in your birthsex’s aisle) fit you pre-transition (in terms of physical body fit, not style/gender expression)?** 📌
⚪ Very well, I could easily find clothes off-the-rack that fit me in most shops
<br>⚪ Somewhat well, I could usually find clothes off-the-rack, but experienced certain fit issues (ex. wrong length, ex. wrong circumference, etc)
<br>⚪ Poorly, so I had to use specialist shops/sections (plus size, extra tall, etc), but could easily find clothes there
<br>⚪ Poorly, so I had to use specialist shops/sections (plus size, extra tall, etc), but still experienced certain fit issues there (ex. wrong length, ex. wrong circumference, etc)
<br>⚪ Very poorly, I’ve never had properly fitting clothes/I needed custom tailoring to have any clothes that fit correctly
<br>⚪ Not applicable (ex. I didn’t shop in birthsex aisle, I only wore homemade clothes, etc)

### **How has medical transition and shopping in the other aisle changed your relationship to standard sizing (in terms of physical body fit, not style/gender expression)?** 📌
⚪ For the better, I can find clothes off-the-rack that fit me properly more easily than before for most garment types
<br>⚪ Neutrally, I can find clothes off-the-rack about as easily/rarely as before and/or there has been an equal trade-off of some kind
<br>⚪ For the worse, it has become much harder to find clothes off-the-rack that fit me properly for most garment types
<br>⚪ Not applicable (ex. I still exclusively shop in my birthsex aisle, I don't adhere to other aisle's way of styling when I shop there (ex. transmascs wearing men's aisle pants on natural waist), I don't shop off-the-rack, etc)

### **What are your most common fit issues with standard sizing (in your target gender’s/opposite of birthsex’s aisle)?**
Clothing in this aspect is: (select any aspects that apply)

| | too much / big / wide / loose / long | too little / small / narrow / tight / short |
|-|-|-|
| Shoulder width | ⚪ | ⚪ |
| Sleeve circumference | ⚪ | ⚪ |
| Sleeve length | ⚪ | ⚪ |
| Chest width | ⚪ | ⚪ |
| Boob space (transfemmes only) | ⚪ | ⚪ |

## Optional questions

### **While I have you here: If you can think of any types of clothes you can never seem to find in your size due to trans-related fit issues but would be particularly useful or just nice to have, please list them here so me and other pattern-makers and fashion people can know what to prioritise making/patterning: (Enter up to 3)** 
(optional)

- Please keep suggestions short (ex. “trousers”, ex. “button-up shirt”, ex. “bra”)
- You can specify basic styles if you want (ex. “a cute oversized sweater”, ex. “a double-breasted suit”, ex. “a lolita dress”, ex. “a bomber jacket”)
- Suggestions can include work wear/uniforms (ex. "scrubs for work", ex. "high vis for work")
- Please stick to regular clothes (ex. something the average cis person can just find at a store, ex. what you might wear in your everyday/to a wedding/to chill at home/to the office/to a date/to pride/to subculture events/etc)
- Anything else (ex. shoes/hats/accessories, trans-specialist underwear, fursuits, fetish/kink-specific items, etc) is outside of the scope of this project

-> Like what’s your craziest, not-actually-that-crazy fashion wish that cis sizes are currently standing in the way of?

### **Fit models**

***(If you don't know me in person, please skip this page)***

I will need some people to pattern test on once we have these trans standard measurements, as well as people to model sample garments at events and photoshoots down the line. 

If you know me in person, are based in the UK, and would potentially be up for volunteering as one of said fit models, please put your first name in the field below. This is so we can reidentify your measurements later so we won't have to retake them to figure out your size.

- ***This will not be part of the final published data set, this is just for my own reference.***
- "Knowing me in person" includes people I was in online support groups with during the pandemic even if they haven't met me "in person".
- Putting your name here doesn't guarantee or obligate you to be a fit model (I will only need a handful of people at the end of the day, and you can change your mind at any point)

I'd be particularly interested in:

- anyone based in Greater Manchester/the North West for pattern testing to make meeting up easier
- anyone of our "special" size categories for pattern testing, regardless of location, as I want to make sure I get those right and can't fit them on myself
- a diverse/representative range of looks beyond just fit (PoC, 40+, etc), regardless of location, for modelling final samples, as the community at large should be represented in the models that will actually be seen by people in the end
- people whose job requires work wear (ex. high vis, scrubs, etc) as I want to try and commission some samples from a manufacturer to illustrate industry use of the measurements, and it'd be cool to have the people actually in those jobs model those samples (and hopefully even get use out of them at work after showing them off, maybe we could even pitch to their employer to fund those samples to that end)

If we've not been in touch for a while, feel free to message me on insta, discord, or similar (@dkettchen) or email me at dkettchen@gmail.com, notably if you'd fit the pattern testing criteria above.

## Following the project

**More info and updates about the project**

All the published files related to this project, including a copy of the information you read at the beginning of the survey and the questionnaire questions, can be found in the project's github repo: 
[https://github.com/dkettchen/trans_standard_sizing](https://github.com/dkettchen/trans_standard_sizing)

The final measurements charts and insights from the survey will also be published there, as well as on my social media (I'm @dkettchen everywhere: [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/dkettchen) • [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/dkettchen.bsky.social) • [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dkettchen/) • [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@DKettchen)) and [website](https://www.dkettchen.com). 
I will likely post updates beyond the final measurements and insights themselves on socials too (ex. making sample garments, going to events to present the project, and any future fashion endeavours enabled by this project).

Note: Only the github repo is dedicated to this project exclusively, the rest are just my regular accounts, so follow at your own risk of whatever other shenanigans I'm up to on there 😅
