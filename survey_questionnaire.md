[confirm and start survey] -->

### First you will be asked some specifics about yourself/your body.

**What is your transition direction (based on birthsex)?** (as we’ll need to check for different things for each)
- Transmasc (afab trans people, FtM, FtX)
- Transfemme (amab trans people, MtF, MtX)

|  <div style="width:40vw">transmasc</div>	| <div style="width:40vw">transfemme</div> | 
|-|-|
| **Have you had top surgery** (double mastectomy via double incision, keyhole/periareolar, or a radical reduction)? - y/n (* this had to be moved to measurements section instead due to google forms' conditional logic limitations) | **Have you had mammoplasty** (augmenting boob job with implants or fat grafts)? - y/n | 
| **Have you had a hysterectomy?** - y/n |  |
| **Are you generally working with more-than-naturally-available-to-you crotch-volume either via (external) bottom surgery or habitual packing?** - y/n | **Are you generally working with crotch-volume similar to that of cis women either via bottom surgery or habitual (successful) tucking?** - y/n | 
| **Have you had any surgery that changed any of your other torso measurements?** (ex. surgical lipo redistribution) - y/n | **Have you had any surgery that changed any of your other torso measurements?** (ex. butt augmentation) - y/n | 
| **Are you on a full/standard dose of testosterone?** - y/n | **Are you on a full/standard dose of estrogen AND either on T-blockers or have had surgery that removes the testes?** - y/n | 
| **If no please specify:** (can select multiple) | **If no please specify:** (can select multiple) | 
| - low dose T (ex. half dose) | - low dose E | 
| - anything else | - neither blockers nor surgery | 
| | - anything else | 
| | **Are you on progesterone?** - y/n | 

**Have you been on your current HRT dose/mix consistently for the entirety of the past 3 years?** - y/n

- **If you changed dose/mix in the past 3 years, how long have you been on your current dose/mix?** 
    - <1 year
    - 1-2 years
    - 2+ years

**How long have you been on HRT** (any dose/mix, without major breaks)?
- 3-5 years
- 5-10 years
- 10+ years

<!-- putting this here due to google forms conditional logic limitations rip -->
|  <div style="width:40vw">transmasc</div>	| <div style="width:40vw">transfemme</div> | 
|-|-|
| **Would you consider yourself very muscular to the point that it may cause fit issues notably in tailored/non-stretch garments like suitwear?** (ex. like it can for say professional athletes or bodybuilders) - y/n	| | 

**What is your age group?**
- 18-29
- 30-39
- 40-49
- 50-59
- 60-69
- 70+

### You will now be asked to take your measurements. 

Make sure you have a measuring tape (or similar) to hand, and maybe a loved one to help you. (You should be able to measure all the core measurements yourself if needed.)

**Please indicate the unit you’ll be measuring in:**

- cm [default to cm]
- inches
<!-- we'll have to check for realistic measurements in data cleaning in case anyone messed this up -->

**Actual measurements:**
<!-- (TODO look up which measurements we need for each direction & instructions for them) -->

<!-- chest measurements first (at least for transmascs) due to branching google form logic for top surgery/no top surgery -->
|  <div style="width:25vw">transmasc (top surgery)</div>	| <div style="width:25vw">transmasc (no top surgery)</div>	| <div style="width:25vw">transfemme</div> | 
|-|-|-|
| chest measurement | underbust measurement | underbust measurement |
|  | (optional) bust measurement (without binder) | bust measurement |
| (optional) nipple distance | (optional) nipple distance (without binder) | nipple distance |
| (optional) distance from clavicle to ends and middle of scars | (optional) bust measurement (with binder) | any other chest measurements for bra purposes (TODO look up) |
| (optional) distance between ends and middle points of scars on one side and the other (like nipple distance) -> so we can triangulate scar point positions | | |
<!-- 
scar measurements are only relevant to ppl who got double incision (or reduction w similar scarring), bc periareolar/keyhole doesn't leave any visible scarring
-->

base measurements everyone will need to fill out
- height
- shoulder height (or like collar bone or smth) (TODO look up)
- neck (TODO look up)
- shoulder
- arm measurements (TODO look up)
- natural waist
- upper hip/male pants waist
- (various distances between things I’m assuming, TODO look up)
- inseam from near crotch bone (-> genital independant)
- outseam from male pant waist
- outseam from natural waist
    - both outseams for both directions so we can later compare to cis measurements better
- rise to natural waist




### You will now be asked some questions about your relationship to standard sizing/off-the-rack fashion pre- and post-transition.

**Did you buy clothes in your birthsex’s aisle pre-transition and if so do you remember your size(s)?**
- Yes
- Pre-transition I never shopped in my birthsex’s aisle/never shopped in adult sizes/never wore store-bought clothes
- I don’t know/remember my size pre-transition

    **What size(s) did you wear/fit you when buying clothes in your birthsex’s aisle pre-transition?** 
    (select up to 3)

    <!-- TODO look up sizing systems & find their corresponding standard measurements if possible -->
    - [sizing system] [size]
    - [sizing system] [size] (optional)
    - [sizing system] [size] (optional)
        <!-- - there will be an option to input custom sizing system & size if it’s not one of the options available
            - should also include existing sizing systems w extreme sizes I may have omitted
            - -> these will include special sizes where at all possible (ie plenty of XLs)
            - include pants sizing bc I know that can be weird w the two measurements -->

**Did you pre-transition and/or do you currently consider yourself any of the following “special” categories?**
(F.e. I would consider myself short by cis male standards, but I am very much average height for a transmasc/afab person)

| <div style="width:20vw">category</div>  | <div style="width:20vw">pre-transition</div> |  <div style="width:20vw">now (compared to cis standards)</div> | <div style="width:20vw">now (compared to trans standards)</div> |
|-|-|-|-|
| plus size | l| l| |
| extra tall   | l| l| l|
| extra short/small/petit(e) | l| l| l|


**How well did standard sizing (in your birthsex’s aisle) fit you pre-transition (in terms of physical body fit, not style/gender expression)?**
- very well, I could easily find clothes off-the-rack that fit me in most shops
- somewhat well, I could usually find clothes off-the-rack, but experienced certain fit issues (ex. wrong length, ex. wrong chest size, etc)
- poorly, so I had to use specialist shops/sections (plus size, extra tall, etc), but could easily find clothes there
- poorly, so I had to use specialist shops/sections (plus size, extra tall, etc), but still experienced certain fit issues there (ex. wrong length, ex. wrong chest size, etc)
- very poorly, I’ve never had properly fitting clothes/I needed custom tailoring to have any clothes that fit correctly
- not applicable 
    > (ex. I didn’t shop in birthsex aisle, ex. I only wore homemade clothes, etc)

**How has medical transition and shopping in the other aisle changed your relationship to standard sizing (in terms of physical body fit, not style/gender expression)?**
- for the better, I can find clothes off-the-rack that fit me properly more easily than before for most garment types
- neutrally, I can find clothes off-the-rack about as easily/rarely as before and/or there has been an equal trade-off of some kind
- for the worse, it has become much harder to find clothes off-the-rack that fit me properly for most garment types
- not applicable 
    > (ex. I don’t shop off-the-rack, ex. I still exclusively shop in birthsex aisle, ex. I don’t adhere to other aisle’s way of styling garments even when I shop there (ex. transmascs wearing men’s aisle pants on their natural waist), etc)

**What are your most common fit issues with standard sizing (in your target gender’s/opposite of birthsex’s aisle)?**

[select any that apply (can leave all empty)] 
<!-- [can only select one column per each] -->

### Some final (optional) questions

####
**(optional) While I have you here: I will be using these measurements to make sewing patterns for people to use, so if you can think of any types of clothes you can never seem to find in your size due to trans-related fit issues but would be particularly useful or just nice to have, please list them here**
[enter up to 3]

- Please keep suggestions short (ex. “trousers”, ex. “button-up shirt”, ex. “bra”)
- You can specify basic styles if you want (ex. “a cute oversized sweater”, ex. “a double-breasted suit”, ex. “a lolita dress”, ex. “a bomber jacket”)
- Suggestions can include work wear/uniforms (ex. "scrubs for work", ex. "high vis for work")
- Please stick to regular clothes (ex. something the average cis person can just find at a store, ex. what you might wear in your everyday/to a wedding/to chill at home/to the office/to a date/to pride/to subculture events/etc) 
- Anything else (ex. shoes/hats/accessories, trans-specialist underwear, fursuits, fetish/kink-specific items, etc) is outside of the scope of this project

-> Like what’s your craziest, not-actually-that-crazy fashion wish that cis sizes are currently standing in the way of?

**Fit models**
***(If you don't know me in person, please skip this page)***

I will need some people to pattern test on once we have these trans standard measurements, as well as people to model sample garments at events and photoshoots down the line. 

If you know me in person, are based in the UK, and would potentially be up for being one of said fit models, please put your first name in the field below. This is so we can reidentify your measurements later so we won't have to retake them to figure out your size.
    - ***This will not be part of the final published data set, this is just for my own reference.***
    - "Knowing me in person" includes people I was in online support groups with during the pandemic even if they haven't met me "in person".
    - Putting your name here doesn't guarantee or obligate you to be a fit model (I will only need a handful of people at the end of the day, and you can change your mind at any point)

I'd be particularly interested in:
    - anyone based in Greater Manchester/the North West for pattern testing to make meeting up easier
    - anyone of our "special" size categories for pattern testing, regardless of location, as I want to make sure I get those right and can't fit them on myself
    - people of a diverse/representative range of looks beyond just fit, regardless of location, for modelling the final samples (explicitly inviting any friends who are f.e. PoC, 40+, etc)
    - people who work in a job where they need work wear (ex. high vis, scrubs, etc) we may be able to commission from a manufacturer, and pitch to their employer to fund so they can actually use them for work after showing them off at events (as it'd be cool to have the actual people in those jobs model the work wear samples)

**If you're interested in being a fit model, please enter your first name here:**
*(you must know me in person and be based in the UK)*
[field to put in name]

If we've not been in touch for a while, feel free to message me on insta, discord, or similar (@dkettchen) or email me at dkettchen@gmail.com, notably if you'd fit the pattern testing criteria above.
