Note: a Japanese dress marked 13-Y-PP or 13-Y-P would be designed for someone with an 89 cm bust and 89 cm hips, while a dress marked 13-B-T would be targeted at a taller individual with 105 cm hips, but the same 89 cm bust. The B fitting adds 12 cm and the T height modifier 4 cm to the base hip measurement 89 + 16 = 105 cm.[13](https://web.archive.org/web/20141111005826/http://web.ita.doc.gov/tacgi/overseasnew.nsf/annexview/Japanese+Size+Charts)[13](http://web.ita.doc.gov/tacgi/overseasnew.nsf/annexview/Japanese+Size+Charts) Additionally there are a set of age based waist adjustments, such that a dress marketed at someone in their 60s may allow for a waist 9 cm larger than a dress, of the same size, marketed at someone in their 20s. The age based adjustments allow for up to a 3 cm increase in girth, per decade of life.
