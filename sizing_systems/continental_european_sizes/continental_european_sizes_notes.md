# Women's

Italian (IT), French (FR) and German (DE) standard dress sizes, s, are calculated by bust circumference, b, and body height, h, both measured in centimetres, as follows:

    IT: s = ⁠b/2⁠
    FR: s = ⁠b/2⁠ − 4 = (⁠b − 8)/2⁠
    DE: s = ⁠b/2⁠ − 6 = (⁠b − 12)/2⁠
        short, petite, h < 164: s' = ⁠s/2⁠ = ⁠b/4⁠ − 3 = (⁠b − 12)/4⁠
        tall, h > 170: s' = 2 × s = b − 12

French sizes are also used by Belgian manufacturers and retailers, while German sizes are also used by Austrian, Dutch and Scandinavian ones. 

# Men's

French (FR) and German (DE) standard suit sizes, s, are calculated by chest circumference, b, measured in centimetres, as follows:

    FR: s = ⁠b/2⁠ + 0.5 = (⁠b + 1)/2⁠
    DE: s = ⁠b/2⁠ − 0.5 = (⁠b − 1)/2⁠
        short, stocky (kurz, untersetzt): s' = ⁠s/2⁠ = ⁠b/4⁠ − 0.25 = (⁠b − 1)/4⁠
        portly (Bauchgröße): s' = s + 1 = ⁠b/2⁠ + 0.5 = (⁠b + 1)/2⁠
        tall, lean (lang, schlank): s' = 2 × (s − 1) = b − 3

French sizes are also used by Belgian manufacturers and retailers, while German sizes are also used by Austrian, Dutch and Scandinavian ones.
