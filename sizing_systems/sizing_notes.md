Reference tables retrieved from [wikipedia article on clothing sizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing_sizes) to get an overview of different sizing systems' numbers/letters labelling different sizes.

These don't seem to cover all sizing systems yet though, as the article also lists other countries' standards, like China and Australia.

[Vanity sizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_sizing)/size inflation, aka the same sizes becoming bigger over time because industry just decides not to follow the standards laid out, is also a thing to consider in connecting measurements to sizes.

    This page also has some tables comparing US sizes over time.

    - fun new vocab word: [anthropometric/anthropometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry), the measurement of the human individual

    - measurements under this system:
        Head girth
            Maximum horizontal girth (circumference) of the head, measured above the ears
        Neck girth
            Girth of the neck measured with the tape measure passed 2 cm below the Adam's apple, and at the level of the 7th cervical vertebra
        Chest girth (♂ men)
            Maximum horizontal girth measured during normal breathing, with the subject standing erect and the tape measure passed over the shoulder blades (scapulae), under the armpits (axillae), and across the chest
        Bust girth (♀ women)
            Maximum horizontal girth measured during normal breathing with the subject standing erect and the tape measure passed horizontally under the armpits (axillae) and across the bust prominence (preferably measured with moderate tension over a brassiere that is expected to be worn underneath)
        Underbust girth (♀ women)
            Horizontal girth of the body measured just below the breasts
        Waist girth
            Girth of the natural waistline between the top of the hip bones (iliac crests) and the lower ribs, measured with the subject breathing normally and standing erect with the abdomen relaxed
        Hip girth (♀ women)
            Horizontal girth measured round the buttocks at the level of maximum circumference
            <!-- ah yes cause men don't have hips let alone a butt, seat measurements def aren't needed for pants drafting naaaaaahhhhh -->
        Height
            Vertical distance between the crown of the head and the soles of the feet, measured with the subject standing erect, without shoes and with the feet together (for infants not yet able to stand upright: length of the body measured in a straight line from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet)
        Inside leg length
            Distance between the crotch and the soles of the feet, measured in a straight vertical line with the subject erect, feet slightly apart, and the weight of the body equally distributed on both legs
        Arm length
            Distance, measured using the tape measure, from the armscye/shoulder line intersection (acromion), over the elbow, to the far end of the prominent wrist bone (ulna), with the subject's right fist clenched and placed on the hip, and with the arm bent at 90°
        Hand girth
            Maximum girth measured over the knuckles (metacarpals) of the open right hand, fingers together and thumb excluded
        Foot length
            Horizontal distance between perpendiculars[clarification needed], in contact, with the end of the most prominent toe and the most prominent part of the heel, measured with the subject standing barefoot and the weight of the body equally distributed on both feet
        Body mass
            Measured with a suitable balance in kilograms.
    - has a table abt which measurements should be indicated for different garment types
    - has some tables about how to indicate measurements as ranges n their medium points
    - has info on labelling bra sizes
    - has letter code version too:
