# Participants
You are invited to take part in this survey if you:
- are trans
- are at least 18 years old
- have been on HRT for at least the last 3 years 
    > as meat changes (muscle/fat redistribution & transfemme breast growth) take ca 3-5 years to finalise
- have not had your first puberty fully replaced 
    > as that would prevent your bones from growing into the wrong hormones and causing these fit issues in the first place

### Clarifications:
- While people who closely fit cis standard sizes pre-transition will be most interesting for checking that our trans sizes end up equivalent, I want to encourage anyone who qualifies by the above criteria to take part as we're trying to capture the full range trans people's measurements can take.
- I also particularly want to encourage plus-sized people to take part, as I hope to also extract trans plus sizes from this data set!
- This project is label agnostic - I don't care what you identify as or what pronouns you use. Nonbinary users can participate as long as they fit the above criteria.
- Can participate but will be asked to mark that specific so we're aware of it when analysing the data later:
    - People on low-dose/other non-standard/custom HRT
    - People who were on HRT for the entire past 3 years, but changed their dose during that time
    - Transmascs who haven't had top surgery
    - Transfemmes who have had mammoplasty
    - People who had surgery that would've changed other torso measurements (ex. transfemmes who had their butt augmented, ex. transmascs who had fat surgically moved from one place to another)

# Before the survey

## What are we asking for/what the survey will entail:
- some details about your body/transition state, and age group (as age impacts posture & measurements hence is relevant to pattern drafting)
- your current measurements 
    - for transfemmes this will include a set of bust measurements used for properly fitting bras (as that's a whole science of its own)
- what size(s) you were in your birthsex's aisle pre-transition (if known)
    - this will include a range of international sizing systems to pick from and a means to write in any missing sizing system
- some additional questions to gage 
    - whether you currently or previously would consider yourself any of the commercially available “special” size categories (i.e. plus size, extra tall, petit(e)) or another bodytype that may need special consideration in pattern drafting (ex. men's tailoring for very muscular builds)
    - how well/poorly you fit standard sizes pre-transition if known
    - transition's impact on your ability to fit standard sizing if any
    - what fit issues you tend to experience with standard sizing if any
- optional suggestion box for garments you would love to see in trans sizing!

## Before starting the survey, make sure you have:
- a measuring tape, or some other means of taking your measurements (ex. string and a ruler)
- some time (TODO estimate)
- (optionally) someone to help you take your measurements

Sign up to our mailing list if you want to be sent the results of this project (ie the Trans Standard Measurements chart) when it's done.

You can also follow me on socials or linkedin for any updates after that (ie when I make sample garments & go to events to present the project).
