You'll need:
- some time
- measuring tape
- long straight object like a ruler
- means to mark measurements on yourself (string & pins (if clothed) or a pen/makeup pencil (if shirtless))
- someone to help you measure
- if you habitually tuck/pack/bind/pad your bra, the means to do so

For now the plan is for the survey to run until May 2026, but this will depend on how many responses we get how quickly. 

If we get a lot of responses I might close the survey in March already. 
If we don't have enough answers by May, I may extend it until Summer.

If you found it in March or later, please check the survey link before reblogging it.
