# Participation Information Sheet

## The trans standard sizing Project
<!-- project description -->

## Who is running this project?
<!-- about me -->

## Who is invited to participate?
<!-- participant requirements -->

You are invited to take part in this survey if you:
- are trans
- are at least 18 years old
- have been on HRT for at least the last 3 years 
    > as meat changes (muscle/fat redistribution & transfemme breast growth) take ca 3-5 years to finalise
- have not had your first puberty fully replaced 
    > as that would prevent your bones from growing into the wrong hormones and causing these fit issues in the first place

### Clarifications:
- While people who closely fit cis standard sizes pre-transition will be most interesting for checking that our trans sizes end up equivalent, I want to encourage anyone who qualifies by the above criteria to take part as we're trying to capture the full range trans people's measurements can take.
- I also particularly want to encourage plus sized people to take part, as I hope to also extract trans plus sizes from this data set!
- This project is label agnostic - I don't care what you identify as or what pronouns you use. Nonbinary users can participate as long as they fit the above criteria.
- Can participate but will be asked to mark that specific so we're aware of it when analysing the data later:
    - People on low-dose/other non-standard/custom HRT
    - People who were on HRT for the entire past 3 years, but changed their dose during that time
    - Transmascs who haven't had top surgery
    - Transfemmes who have had mammoplasty
    - People who had surgery that would've changed other torso measurements (ex. transfemmes who had their butt augmented, ex. transmascs who had fat surgically moved from one place to another)

## Do I have to take part?
No, participation is voluntary and you can quit out of the survey at any point without submitting your responses.

## What will I be asked to do?
Fill out a survey, part of which will include taking your measurements.

## What information about me will you collect and why?
<!-- explain what survey will ask about and reasons for each -->

The survey will ask for:
- Your transition direction based on birthsex (transmasc/transfemme), as this is the only gender metric we will be grouping respondants by. (Again, this project is label agnostic.)
- Generic information about your physical body, including age and some info about your medical transition state (ex. types of (torso) surgeries you've had, if any), as these things impact your measurements.
- Your measurements. We will use everyone's measurements to calculate our trans standard measurements later.
- Generic information about your bodytype. This will help us categorise people with similar pattern drafting considerations and enable us to extract trans sizing not just for "regular" sizes but also "special" size categories like plus size, extra tall, and petit(e).
- What size(s) you wore and how well you fit them pre-transition, if known. This will help us make sure that trans standard sizing will fit people as well as cis standard sizing did pre-transition.
- How your relationship to standard sizing has changed with changing aisles and what fit issues you commonly encounter now. This will help us illustrate and back up with statistical data that this is a common issue among our community, as well as inform pattern drafting to alleviate those fit issues.
- (optionally) Your suggestions for garments you'd like to see available in trans sizing. This will help me and others know which patterns to prioritise making.
- (optionally) If you know me in person and you're willing to be a fit model for my own pattern testing and/or to model finished clothes at events/photoshoots down the line, your first name, so I can reidentify your measurements and we won't have to retake them later. *This will be not be part of the published data set, this is just for my own reference.*

The questions on your body and relationship to standard sizing will also help provide context and enable crossreferencing of your responses for data analysis.
> ex. What impact does your category have on your relationship to standard sizing and fit issues you may experience?

This data is collected in the public interest, as this project aims to benefit the global trans and gender diverse community, and make its data publicly available (ex. for further research).

## What will happen to my information after the survey?
<!-- explain data stuff incl github, publishing, anonymity & that we won't be able to delete/update it-->

The survey responses will be anonymised where not already anonymous. No individual respondant will be able to be identified based on their published data.

The anonymous responses will then be published on [the project's github repository](https://github.com/dkettchen/trans_standard_sizing), where they will remain publicly available indefinitely for anyone who may find them useful.

As the responses will be anonymous and published for open access, we won't be able to delete or update your data after the fact.

## How will you use my information?
<!-- explain abt data processing? -->

I will clean the data and use the collected measurements and context data to extract trans standard measurements for "regular" sizing as well as our "special" categories (ex. plus size, etc).

I will also do some statistical data analysis to draw basic insights from the responses. (ex. Just how common are these trans fit issues? ex. Does unusual height alleviate/aggravate certain fit issues? etc)

## What will happen to the results of the project?
<!-- explain abt open publishing, mailing list, possible paper -->

The resulting trans standard measurements will be published for anyone to use. 
They will be available on [the project's github repository](https://github.com/dkettchen/trans_standard_sizing), [my website](https://www.dkettchen.com) and socials (@dkettchen), and they will be sent to anyone who signed up to [the project's mailing list]().

The project's data, including the raw, anonymised survey responses, any code written for it, documentation, and the final results, will be openly available on the github repo, and possibly added to academic repositories down the line as well.

I will make sample garments and present the project at relevant tech/fashion/lgbt+ events after the survey and data processing part of the project have concluded.

After the project I also plan on writing a paper about it to be published in relevant academic/industry/community outlets.
