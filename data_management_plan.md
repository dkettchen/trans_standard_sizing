# Data Management Plan
[last updated December 2025]

Ren Zoller is in charge of all aspects of this project, including data management.

## What kind of data are you generating
- A set of questionnaire responses
- A set of standard measurements to use to pattern draft garments for trans people
- Software to clean and process the former dataset into the latter
- Any supporting documentation for the project

## How much data will you generate
The survey responses will be determined by the number of respondants. We expect a few hundred to a few thousand if the survey goes especially viral. For reference, [much more established gender diverse surveys](https://www.gendercensus.com/) get up to 50k responses which make for a single ~20MB csv file, so this one will get nowhere near that big.

Standard measurements usually make a page-sized table per each set. There will be measurements for regular size, plus size, extra tall, and petit(e) for either transition direction.

The software will be some code files organised in an appropriate folder structure.

Supporting documentation will be a few text files in relevant formats.

## What standards and methodologies will you use?
For methodology, please see our methodology documents.

## Is the data sensitive? How will this be managed?
Any sensitive data, like age or medical information, will be collected as generically as possible and anonymised where not already anonymous before publishing. 

No participant will be individually identifyable based on their published responses. 

Participants will be asked to confirm their informed consent to participate before undertaking the survey.

## Where will the data be stored?
The active survey is hosted on google forms.

After the survey concludes, I will anonymise the response data and back it up to [a repository on github](https://github.com/dkettchen/trans_standard_sizing), where all other project data (ie code etc) will also be stored. 

A copy of the non-anonymous parts like email addresses for the mailing list and first names of fit models will be held on my computer. The mailing list data will be deleted after the project results have been sent out.

The final data will be publicly available on [github](https://github.com/dkettchen/trans_standard_sizing) indefinitely. The published survey data and results will likely also be available on relevant other repository sites, and the resulting trans standard measurements will be shared across social media, our mailing list and [Ren's website](https://www.dkettchen.com).

## Will the data be valuable for future research?
Any datasets on small minority groups like the trans community are rare and therefore invaluable.

The survey's aim is to generate a dataset that is not only useful to this project's practical goal of producing trans standard sizing, but also hopefully to future research about trans people's relationship to standard sizing in their birthsex aisle pre-transition and in their target gender aisle post-transition. It may be able to lend insight into questions like:

- How commonly do trans people actually experience fit issues due to being trans?
- What fit issues are most common?
- Does unconventional height for one's birthsex aggravate/alleviate common fit issues?
- How does their relationship to standard sizing change as they transition?
- How does bodytype (ex. plus size) influence that relationship?

However due to the limited aims of this project and the rarity of our target demographic (surveys on cis people would be able to easily find enough respondants in any country on its own, but trans people make up less than 0.5% of the general population even in the most lgbt+-tolerant countries, so we're running this survey globally to get as many respondants as we can), we did not go out of our way to try and make the dataset representative of the entire trans community beyond what is needed for the project, so it should not be assumed to be representative of any aspect outside of those relevant to the scope of the project.

> Ex. The survey is in english to assure the widest reach possible globally, but this will likely bias the responses towards the natively-english-speaking world and its particular racial distribution. We will assume that race and country of origin do not relevantly impact human proportions (within the same height/bodytype/etc), and therefore that this bias will not detract from our aim to create standard measurements that can fit most trans people, but we are not collecting data on respondants' race or location, and the additional questions will not be culturally representative of the global trans community and their experiences.

> Ex. The project is meant to help trans people who are post-transition, trying to be read as their target gender, and struggling to find appropriately fitting target gender clothes off-the-rack. Not all trans people are in this position and those less affected by this specific circumstance may feel less inclined to participate, and, even if they do, their fashion habits will be less well-explored by the questions of the survey. I know there have been other studies documenting what say nonbinary people wear (I know cause I participated in one at the time lol), so hopefully those can lend insight into the gaps left by this dataset.
