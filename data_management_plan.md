# Data Management Plan
[last updated December 2025]

Ren Zoller is in charge of all aspects of this project, including data management.

## What kind of data are you generating
- A set of questionnaire responses
- A set of standard measurements to use to pattern draft garments for trans people
- Software to clean and process the former dataset into the latter
- Any supporting documentation for the project

## How much data will you generate
The survey responses will be determined by the number of respondants. We expect a few hundred to a few thousand if the survey goes especially viral. For reference, [much more established gender diverse surveys](https://www.gendercensus.com/) get up to 50k responses which make for a single ~20MB csv file, so this one will get nowhere near that big.

Standard measurements usually make a page-sized table per each set. There will be measurements for regular size, plus size, extra tall, and petit(e) for either transition direction.

The software will be some code files organised in an appropriate folder structure.

Supporting documentation will be a few text files in relevant formats.

## What standards and methodologies will you use?
For methodology, please see our [methodology](methodology.md) document.

## Is the data sensitive? How will this be managed?
Any sensitive data, like age or medical information, will be collected as generically as possible and anonymised where not already anonymous before publishing. 

No participant will be individually identifyable based on their published responses. 

Participants will be asked to confirm their informed consent to participate before undertaking the survey.

## Where will the data be stored?
The active survey is hosted on google forms.

After the survey concludes, I will anonymise the response data and back it up to [a repository on github](https://github.com/dkettchen/trans_standard_sizing), where all other project data (ie code etc) will also be stored. 

A copy of the non-anonymous parts like first names of fit models will be held on my computer and deleted after fulfilling their purpose or a relevant amount of time. 

The final data will be publicly available on [github](https://github.com/dkettchen/trans_standard_sizing) indefinitely. The published survey data and results will likely also be available on relevant other repository sites, and the resulting trans standard measurements will be shared across social media and [Ren's website](https://www.dkettchen.com).

## Will the data be valuable for future research?
Any datasets on small minority groups like the trans community are rare and therefore invaluable.

The survey's aim is to generate a dataset that is not only useful to this project's practical goal of assessing trans proportions and producing trans standard sizing, but also hopefully to future research about trans people's relationship to standard sizing in their birthsex aisle pre-transition and in their target gender aisle post-transition. 

However due to the limited aims of this project and the rarity of our target demographic (surveys on cis people would be able to easily find enough respondants in any country on its own, but trans people make up less than 0.5% of the general population even in the most lgbt+-tolerant countries, so we're running this survey globally to get as many respondants as we can), we did not go out of our way to try and make the dataset representative of the entire trans community beyond what is needed for the project, so it should not be assumed to be representative of any aspect outside of those relevant to the scope of the project as defined in our [methodology doc](methodology.md).
